# an antisocial model of disability

this talk asks what frames accessibility, and what becomes visible when we stop treating accessibility as a purely technical concern. 
drawing from modern art, it explores how data visualizations and other technical works inherit artistic traditions that quietly shape what is seen, what is hidden, and who is invited into the work. 
shifting from reading visualizations to viewing them opens a different kind of attention, one that notices the boundary where the artist’s labor, choices, and context reside.

within the boundary of the frame, we encounter the structures that define inclusion and exclusion. 
the frame becomes a site where meaning exceeds the visual, where the invisible work around the work becomes newly salient. 
this perspective offers a way to understand accessibility not as an afterthought or a checklist, 
but as a creative and relational practice shaped by the same forces that shape art itself. 
it is at the frame that we can move closer to meeting artists where they are in their own time and place.

through this lens, the talk invites folks to experiment with art and reproduction as a method for rethinking technical practice. 
making art, even imperfectly, cultivates questions that help bring accessibility earlier into the process: what am i including and excluding, 
how do i make the implicit explicit, how can i make the imperceptible perceptible.
