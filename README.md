# an antisocial framing of technical disability

> “The poet, the artist, the sleuth—whoever sharpens our perception tends to be antisocial; rarely “well adjusted,” <ins>t</ins>he<ins>y</ins> cannot go along with currents and trends.” - marshall mcluhan

this talk explores what happens when we stop treating accessibility as a purely technical concern; how data visualizations and other technical communications could consider what is seen, what is hidden, and who is invited into the work, as modern art does. 

this perspective offers a way to understand accessibility not as an afterthought or a checklist, but as a creative and relational practice. 

through this lens, the talk invites folks to experiment with art and reproduction as a method for rethinking technical practice. making art, even imperfectly, cultivates questions that could be used bring accessibility earlier into the process: what/who am i including and excluding, how do i make the implicit explicit, and what senses are used to portray this narrative?
